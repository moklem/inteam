    <Card
      sx={{
        transition: 'all 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)',
        '&:hover': {
          transform: 'translateY(-2px)',
          boxShadow: (theme) => theme.shadows[8]
        }
      }}
    >
      <CardContent>
        <Typography variant="h6" component="h2">
          {event.title}
        </Typography>
        <Typography color="text.secondary">
          {formatDateToGerman(event.date)}
        </Typography>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  )
}
```

### Advanced Styling Techniques
```javascript
// Pigment CSS integration for v6+ performance
const StyledButton = styled(Button)(({ theme }) => ({
  borderRadius: theme.spacing(1),
  textTransform: 'none',
  fontWeight: 600,
  '&:hover': {
    backgroundColor: alpha(theme.palette.primary.main, 0.04)
  }
}))

// Custom theme with German considerations
const theme = createTheme({
  typography: {
    fontFamily: '"Roboto", "Helvetica", "Arial", sans-serif',
    h1: {
      fontSize: '2.125rem',
      fontWeight: 300,
      lineHeight: 1.235
    }
  },
  palette: {
    primary: {
      main: '#1976d2' // Volleyball team blue
    },
    secondary: {
      main: '#dc004e' // Accent color
    }
  },
  components: {
    MuiButton: {
      styleOverrides: {
        root: {
          borderRadius: 8,
          textTransform: 'none'
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```
