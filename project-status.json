Backward compatibility ensures that Universal players who completed self-assessments before this update will have their position automatically detected from existing sub-attribute data, so coaches can immediately rate their position-specific attributes without requiring players to redo their self-assessment.

The system provides valuable insights for self-improvement while maintaining strict privacy protection. Players see percentile rankings (e.g., '75th percentile in Aufschlag' means 75% of teammates have lower serve ratings) with clear strength/weakness identification and improvement recommendations. The feature requires minimum 5 players per team to prevent individual identification and includes comprehensive privacy controls. This creates a motivating comparison system that helps players understand their relative position and focus on specific skill areas without creating competitive pressure or exposing teammates' weaknesses."
