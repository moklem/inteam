### How Sub-Agents Work
Sub-agents are lightweight, specialized AI assistants that:
- Run with independent context windows (preserving main conversation context)
- Execute tasks in parallel (up to 10 concurrent agents)
- Have configurable tool access for security and focus
- Are stateless and isolated from each other
- Can be invoked automatically based on context or explicitly by name

## Safety & Trust Framework (Anthropic's 2025 Guidelines)

### 1. Keeping Humans in Control
- **Read-only by default**: Agents start with minimal permissions
- **Explicit approval**: Require human confirmation for write operations
- **Interruptible**: Users can stop agents at any time
- **Todo tracking**: Real-time visibility of agent actions via TodoWrite tool

### 2. Transparency in Agent Behavior
- **Clear descriptions**: Each agent explains its intended actions
- **Progress visibility**: Show step-by-step progress through todo lists
- **Decision reasoning**: Agents explain why they're taking specific actions
- **Error reporting**: Clear communication when agents encounter issues

### 3. Value Alignment
- **Project-specific prompts**: Agents understand volleyball-app's specific needs
- **Preserve functionality**: Never break existing features
- **Follow conventions**: Maintain existing code patterns and standards
- **Respect production**: Understand this is a live app with real users

### 4. Privacy Protection
- **Isolated contexts**: Each agent has separate context window
- **No cross-contamination**: Agent tasks don't leak between contexts
- **Secure credentials**: Never expose or log sensitive information
- **MCP protocol**: Use secure protocols for external integrations

### 5. Security First
- **Limited tool access**: Grant only necessary tools per agent
- **Input validation**: Always validate and sanitize inputs
- **Prompt injection defense**: Agents trained to resist malicious prompts
- **Audit trails**: Track all agent actions for review

## Implementation Recommendations

### Quick Start Guide

#### 1. Create Agent Directory
```bash
mkdir -p .claude/agents
```

#### 2. Generate Agents with Claude
Use the `/agents` command in Claude Code to generate initial agents:
```
/agents create pwa-specialist
/agents create react-performance-optimizer
/agents create mongodb-database-specialist
/agents create api-developer
```

#### 3. Customize System Prompts
Edit each agent file in `.claude/agents/` with the provided templates above.

### Immediate Priority (Phase 1)
Start with these 4 essential agents:
1. `pwa-specialist` - Core PWA functionality
2. `react-performance-optimizer` - Performance optimization
3. `mongodb-database-specialist` - Database optimization
4. `api-developer` - API development

### Agent Invocation Patterns

#### Automatic Delegation
Claude Code automatically delegates to appropriate agents based on context:
```
"Fix the service worker caching issue" → pwa-specialist
"Optimize the events page loading" → react-performance-optimizer
"Add index to improve query performance" → mongodb-database-specialist
```

#### Explicit Invocation
```
"Use the test-automator agent to create tests for the auth flow"
"Have the security-auditor review the JWT implementation"
```

#### Parallel Execution Example
```
"Use multiple agents to:
1. pwa-specialist: Review service worker
2. security-auditor: Check authentication
3. test-automator: Create missing tests"
```

### Integration with Notion MCP

#### Workflow Automation
```markdown
---
name: notion-task-processor
description: Processes tasks from Notion backlog automatically
tools: Task, mcp__notionApi__API-get-block-children, mcp__notionApi__API-update-a-block
---

- Use Opus for any task requiring architectural decisions or security implications
- Consider parallel execution with multiple Sonnet agents vs single Opus agent

## Safety-First Agent Design Principles

### Production App Considerations
Given that volleyball-app is a **production application with active users**, all agents must:

1. **Minimize Risk**
   - Default to read-only operations
   - Request approval for any changes
   - Test in isolation before applying
   - Never experiment on production data

2. **Maintain Stability**
   - Preserve all existing functionality
   - Avoid breaking changes
   - Respect backward compatibility
   - Consider deployment timing

3. **Transparent Operations**
   - Use TodoWrite to track all actions
   - Explain what will be changed and why
   - Show before/after comparisons
   - Document all modifications

4. **Gradual Rollout**
   - Test changes on test branch first
   - Deploy during low-traffic periods
   - Monitor for issues post-deployment
   - Have rollback plans ready
